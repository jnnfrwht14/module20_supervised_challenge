# module20_supervised_creditrisk

## Purpose of the analysis: 
* The financial information provided was a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
* The goal was to predict loans with a high risk of defaulting.

  ### Machine learning was used:
* Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

* Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

* Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
  * Generate a confusion matrix.
  * Print the classification report.
* I used LogisticRegression to predict defaulting the loans, using train_test_split.

## Results:

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.


## Summary:

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
